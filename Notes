#Use Get-Help you fucking animal

When you invoke Get-Help on a cmdlet, a help page is returned. The page includes many sections. You'll likely see these common sections:

    NAME: Provides the name of the command.
    SYNTAX: Shows ways to call the command by using a combination of flags, and sometimes, allowed parameters.
    ALIASES: Lists any aliases for a command. An alias is a different name for a command, and it can be used to invoke the command.
    REMARKS: Provides information about what commands to run to get more help for this command.
    PARAMETERS: Provides details about the parameter. It lists its type, a longer description, and acceptable values, if applicable.
\
If you don't want to display the full help page, narrow the response by adding flags to your Get-Help command. Here are some flags you can use:

    -Full: Returns a detailed help page. It specifies information like parameters, inputs, and outputs that you don't get in the standard response.
    -Detailed: Returns a response that looks like the standard response, but it includes a section for parameters.
    -Examples: Returns only examples, if any exist.
#    -Online: Opens a web page for your command.
    -Parameter: Requires a parameter name as an argument. It lists a specific parameter's properties.
